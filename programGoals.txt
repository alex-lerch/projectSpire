program design:
	player's character auto-fights using their base attack value and skills a percentage of the time.
	The percentage of the time that a particular skill will be used should be displayed.
	it should be possible for the character to have their base attack and a number of skills used on the
	same turn if they are lucky enough for the numbers to be rolled.
	after each battle the player is presented with a few boons(equipment/skills/stats/refill health)
	and they can choose any one among them. boons must be randomly generated with powerful ones generated
	less frequently. At the start of a new round player should be presented with two options for which
	enemy to battle next.

	any items that provide defense percentage should contribute to the character's overall defense
	percentage. This percentage indicates how frequently incoming damage will be negated.
	this percentage should be displayed for the player to see during battle.

	possible alternative theme to game:
			
			player is the night.

			Story: A child does not want to go to school anymore (possible reason: they are being
			bullied, or they don't want to take a test). The night hears the child's wish and decides
			to resist relenting and giving
			way to the daytime. The moon decides to help the night defeat the day.
			The day finds out about this and sends warriors of light. The night
			must defeat all of the warriors of light to defeat the day and bring about permanent
			nighttime. The day sends two enemies per round. The moon automatically defeats one enemy
			for free. This means the player simply chooses which of the two enemies they would like to
			fight that round.
			The sun is the final boss

			possible rewards:
					allies that have different status effects (ex: the tide, selenophobia, etc.)
					increase of atk
					increase of def percentage
					heal a portion of health
